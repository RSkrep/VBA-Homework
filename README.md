# VBA-Homework
The entirety of this project was to solidify the use to VBA (Visual Basic Analytics) coding within excel in relation to data analytics.

This project consisted of gaining a data set on stock market value then using VBA to expand upon and gain further information from it that would assist a data analyst.

With this the project then required that a new series of columns be created to record the following
•	The ticker symbol associated with the corresponding stock.
•	Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
•	The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
•	The total stock volume of the stock.
Once these columns were added using the VBA code, the next step was to create three more columns to provide further information regarding the data set. The three columns added were:
•	Greatest % increase 
•	Greatest % decrease
•	Greatest total volume
These, three value were used to provide a more direct look at the extreme of the data and offer a specialized look at the data set. Being able to utilize VBA to sort through the entirety of the data to pinpoint specific values was the key priority of this exercise.
Then to better organize the data, conditional formatting was used on the columns yearly change and percentage change. The formatting was used change the internal index colors of the cells to match either red or green depending on if the value was a negative or a positive. 
Lastly, the VBA code needed to be altered to make sure that it would run through all worksheet tabs of the data set (corresponding to differing years) at once instead of having to redo the code each time for each new tab.

The worksheet function code used in the code was provided by the course instructional assistant Pankaj Gautam

Due to issues with excel on my laptop, my code only works on my practice sheet and not the final sheet. Therefore, I will be providing screenshots of the practice sheet. The code was given to Pankaj to test on a stronger more reliable computer and worked successfully on the true data sheet for him.
